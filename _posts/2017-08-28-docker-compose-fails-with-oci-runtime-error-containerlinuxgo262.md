Attempting to create a pair of containers with `docker-compose` but I'm getting
error messages like

    oci runtime error: container_linux.go:262

Tool versions

    $ docker -v
    Docker version 17.06.1-ce, build 874a7374f3
    $ docker-compose -v
    docker-compose version 1.15.0, build unknown

And my Docker compose file was

    version: '3.3'

    services:
      db:
        image: postgres
        environment:
          POSTGRES_PASSWORD: p420w0rd
          POSTGRES_DB: test
        volumes:
          - postgres:/var/lib/postgresql/data

      adminer:
        image: adminer
        ports:
          - 8080:8080

    volumes:
      postgres:

But attempting to bring them up returns errors:

    $ docker-compose up --remove-orphans

Looking around the net, I saw someone mentioning that this might come from a kernel error.
Perhaps it arised from a kernel update of which I did not reboot afterwards.

**A reboot solved the issue with no sight of the error messages.**

Looking at the package manager logs, I can see when I last updated the kernel:

    $ grep 'upgraded linux' /var/log/pacman.log
    [2017-08-21 10:22] [ALPM] upgraded linux (4.12.8-1 -> 4.12.8-2)

And my last reboot was before that

    $ journalctl --list-boots
     -1 f1e4a0f684ae4e3ca199874501e32d5f Thu 2017-08-10 12:50:08 CESTâ€”Mon 2017-08-28 17:27:52 CEST

So that seems to actually be the case for me.
