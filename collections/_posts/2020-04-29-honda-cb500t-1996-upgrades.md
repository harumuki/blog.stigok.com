These are the notes for servicing my Honda CB500 1996 (T) Italy motorbike.

A problem with the 1994-2001 CB500, is that Honda CB's are very popular in
general. Both for enthusiasts and for modern retro stylers. Mostly models
from the 1970s. This pollutes search results, so I make sure I take note of
sites, videos and articles I find for my specific make.

## Parts overview

I've come to find some different online shops to order parts from. They have
their pros and cons.

- [Thansen](https://www.thansen.no/scooter-mc/motorsykkel-og-mx/reservedeler/honda/cb500/)
  is a Norwegian shop that offers decently priced parts, categorised into my
  model, and all parts are labeled with model year. The prices + shipping
  are final, which means I don't need to worry about getting an additional
  bill for import taxes and handling.
- [CMS NL](https://www.cmsnl.com/honda-cb500-1996-t-italy_model1571/) is
  a shop based in Netherlands. It's an extra security that I know the parts
  will fit my bike, since they keep a thorough register for each model.
  Some parts are vastly over-priced, but for general items, it's okay.
- eBay has a lot of after-market listings. It comes with the extra work of
  making sure the parts will *actually* fit. Talk to the sellers, and make
  measurements before ordering.

### Head crown bearings

Original bearings are roll-cage bearings. Enthusiast bike mechanics I've seen
videos and comments from, says this is a typical part of the bike which is
never serviced or inspected by the typical owner(s).

After looking into this, and looking at great videos regarding bearings, I
want tapered roller bearings.

I found a kit for 30 euros, which I think is a great price. Especially as I
*I know* it will fit by bike (I'm buying from a shop that lets me choose
supported models).

[Upgrade kit](https://www.cmsnl.com/honda-cb500-1996-t-italy_model1571/tapered-steering-bearing-kit_ssh903r/).
The fit is described as upper dimensions 26 x 47 x 15mm
and lower as 30 x 55 x 17mm.

### Suspension / Rear cushions

I suspect the rear cushion on my bike has never been changed or serviced.
I was surprised at the price for original parts from some vendors. It had me
looking for alternative parts.

As of end of April 2020, original **pairs** are around €700. After-market
alternatives are between €240 - €420.  Used pairs goes for around €100, but
I want something new, for my part.
